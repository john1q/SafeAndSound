#Safe and Sound
Today, listening to music and absorbing content using headphones is very convenient and practical, but this entails a great danger for users - there is a chance of not noticing a car, bus and other types of transport.
As practice proves, pedestrians with headphones are disoriented in space, lose their coordination, not to mention the fact that they simply do not hear the sound of an approaching vehicle.
Safe & Sound is designed to minimize pedestrian injuries and deaths on the road. The application analyzes the sound spectrum of the environment (using a microphone) and reduces the sound volume when a vehicle is detected.
